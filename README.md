This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Experimental project with the use of NEXTJS and TailwindCSS

## Modern Design: 
We will implement a sleek and contemporary design that resonates with TEDx's brand identity. The website will feature responsive layouts and a mobile-first approach to cater to a diverse audience.

## Fast Load Times: 
Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for optimized styles, we will ensure that the website achieves fast load times and a smooth browsing experience.

## Engaging User Experience: 
The website will be intuitively structured, making it easy for users to explore TEDx DAVV's events, speakers, and ideas. We'll incorporate interactive elements to enhance user engagement.
